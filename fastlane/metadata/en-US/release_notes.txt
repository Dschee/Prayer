NEW:
- Adds a new audio mode where a computer voice reads out loud the full text of the prayer.
- Ensures the new spoken text audio mode continues to play when device is locked or app is in background.
- Shows the currently connected audio device and adds a button to switch the device right within the app.
- Adds detailed descriptions below each settings section to give some additional context.

CHANGED:
- Position change sound now ignores the systems Mute switch setting. Set audio mode to `muted` instead to pray without any sounds.
- All settings entries now have an icon for faster recognition and to make the settings screen look nicer.

FIXED:
- Adjusted green accent color in dark mode to be brighter for more legible text on buttons.
