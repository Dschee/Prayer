Use the regular prayers to read the Quran.\n\nCurrently the app contains only the last twelve surahs of the Quran and randomly selects between them while one is staying during a prayer, but this is only the first step. With updates we are to follow all the missing surahs, and we also have a planned solution for longer surahs so that you can read them bit by bit to be able to pray and understand them without losing context.\n\nSpecifically NOT the purpose of this app is to teach praying from the ground up. Knowledge of the fundamentals of the prayers is already assumed, the app is intended primarily to move from doing your prayers in a foreign language (Arabic) to a language which you already mastered (currently: English, German and Turkish).";

"SETTINGS.FAQ_ENTRIES.LANGUAGE.ANSWER" = "We are convinced that the Quran prescribes regular prayers above all to be aware of God and to remember his guidance. Words that can not be understood neither warn against the wrong path, nor show the right path which is, at the end, what the Quran aims to do.\n\nIn any case, we can not imagine that God wants us to merely admire the beauty of the sound of his lyrics five times a day. The Arabic in the Quran may be perfect and supreme in its meaning, but as long as the person doing the prayer has not mastered the Arabic language, his prayers in Arabic are imperfect. Moreover, we do not know a Quran verse which requires prayers to be done in Arabic.";

"SETTINGS.FAQ_ENTRIES.LANGUAGE_MIX.ANSWER" = "Actually this app is meant to be able to get away from the Arabic language, if you did not master it. An alternative usage method would be to use the app as a supplement to prayers in Arabic, in order to be able to read the meaning next to it. Because we are convinced that prayers are all about meaning, we advise against it to not make the prayers unnecessarily complicated, but for some, this may be the only acceptable way what we can understand. We recommend setting the \"Changing text name\" setting for this application method.";

"SETTINGS.FAQ_ENTRIES.TRANSLATION_PROBLEM.ANSWER" = "We understand that regular prayers are something so important that you want to do everything as correct as possible. We also understand that in religion many different opinions about the meaning of the same text prevail, and it is important that you remain as close as possible to the original text.\n\nThis is why we absolutely want you to read the Quran yourself, not the narratives and traditions of those who have studied the Quran for years and try to enlighten you (supposedly), and above all not those who try to teach you about \"the real message of the Koran\". We are convinced that this distinction is only possible if you read the Quran for yourself what this App tries to help with.";
