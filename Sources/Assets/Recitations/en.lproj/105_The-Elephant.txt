Art thou not aware of how thy Sustainer dealt with the Army of the Elephant?
Did He not utterly confound their artful planning?
Thus, He let loose upon them great swarms of flying creatures
which smote them with stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained,
and caused them to become like a field of grain that has been eaten down to stubble â€“
