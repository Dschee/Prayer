<summary>Formatting Rules for Entries</summary>
Each entry should use the following format:

```markdown
- Summarize what was changed in a single line.  
  Issue: [#0](https://github.com/Flinesoft/Prayer/issues/0) | PR: [#0](https://github.com/Flinesoft/Prayer/pull/0) | Author: [Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/Jeehut)
```

Note that at the end of the summary line, you need to add two whitespaces (`  `) for correct rendering on GitHub.

If needed, pluralize to `Issues`, `PRs` or `Authors` and list multiple separated by `, `.
