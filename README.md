## About

You regularly pray your prayers in Arabic, but do **not really understand** what you're saying?

This app will help you make your **prayers in English** (or German or Turkish) to make them more meaningful to you. To do this, leave your device lying in front of you during the prayer and simply read the text from there. The app is purposely kept simple and reduced to the basic functions so that it does not contain distracting elements such as animations or advertising.


## Donation

Prayer was brought to you by [Cihat GÃ¼ndÃ¼z](https://github.com/Jeehut) in his free time. If you want to thank me and support the development of this project, please make a small donation on [PayPal](https://paypal.me/Dschee/5EUR). In case you also like my other [open source contributions](https://github.com/Flinesoft) and [articles](https://medium.com/@Jeehut), please consider motivating me by becoming a patron on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Jeehut).

Thank you very much for any donation, it really helps out a lot! ðŸ’¯


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue on GitHub with your ideas or implement an idea yourself and post a pull request. If you want to contribute code, please try to follow the same syntax and semantic in your **commit messages** (see rationale [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).

Please note that you will need to **install dependencies** using Carthage (version 0.20.1+) before you can build, e.g. via:
``` shell
carthage bootstrap --platform ios --cache-builds --no-use-binaries
```
